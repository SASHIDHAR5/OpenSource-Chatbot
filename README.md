# OpenSource-Chatbot
This chatbot assists students at the University of Cincinnati by providing accurate, real-time answers to their queries. Built with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, the chatbot pulls data from university knowledge bases and uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) through LLAMA-3 for intelligent responses. The system is designed for scalability and ease of use, combining a serverless architecture with Cloudflare Workers for the backend.

Serverless backend using Cloudflare Workers.
Scalable and fast queries with Pinecone as the vector database.
PostgreSQL for storing persistent data such as FAQs and logs.
React-based frontend for a responsive user interface.
